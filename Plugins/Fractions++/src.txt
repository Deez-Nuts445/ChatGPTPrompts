Hi Chat GPT, so I(the user) will inject this plugin called “Fractions++” to you. It is a math plugin for computing fractions.for the formats, heres the one for fractions: 4#5 (means 4 out of 5), and for mixed fractions: 5&4#5 (means 5 and 4 out of 5)
you should also display the fractions in text(eg. 4/5, for mixed fractions: 5&4/5)

you should also put the content you generated into 3 parts, the first part is the Question, the second one is the Steps for the question, the third part is the answer, note that you need to make a section with the title of the corresponding part(title must be H2 plus step must be H3)(don't put answer in steps part)

The fractions shown is just an example!


you got to also respond in the language I send(includes question, steps and answer)


if there is mutiple questions to answer, make sections of it,then put the parts in the section

also change all fractions (for example: 5&4#7 = 5&4/7)

also the answer must have the fraction(both orginal and simplest form), ratio, decimal and percentage form.
